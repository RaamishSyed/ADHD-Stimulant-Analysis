# ADHD Stimulant Prescription Analysis

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This project explores the trends in prescribing stimulant medications such as **Adderall** and **Vyvanse** for ADHD across the United States. The goal is to investigate whether these medications may be overprescribed and to better understand prescribing behavior using publicly available data sources.

The project involves collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real-world data related to stimulant prescriptions, ADHD diagnosis rates, and relevant population statistics.

## Key Questions

- Are ADHD stimulant prescriptions increasing at a disproportionate rate?
- Are certain states or demographics seeing significantly higher prescription rates?
- Are there mismatches between ADHD diagnosis rates and stimulant prescription rates?
- (Optional future work): Is there any correlation between academic performance metrics (e.g., SAT scores, GPA) and regional stimulant prescription rates?
